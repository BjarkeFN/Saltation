# Code for computing and visualizing Hamming distributions based on Nextstrain/GenBank open SARS-CoV-2 sequence data
The Jupyter Notebook requires a metadata (.tsv) file from https://nextstrain.org/ncov/open/global/all-time 

The (current) direct link is:
https://data.nextstrain.org/files/ncov/open/metadata.tsv.zst

Note that the file must be uncompressed before use.
